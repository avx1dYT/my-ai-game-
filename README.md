The game is fully developed with artificial intelligence and inspired by GTA 1. It is still under development due to a bug that AI has not been able to fix. The APK file of the game is available for testing. Although textures and elements like the police, wanted level, NPCs, and the ability to shoot are missing, it can be played with a controller, currently compatible only with Xbox controllers, and allows mapping controls to your liking. It offers the option to play at 30 or 60 FPS. Enjoy the game! ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
