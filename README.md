The game has been entirely developed using artificial intelligence and takes inspiration from the classic GTA 1. Although it's still in development, it shows promise as a unique project. Currently, the game remains unfinished due to a bug that AI has yet to resolve. However, you can already test it by downloading the APK file, which is available for early access.

At the moment, some features and elements are still missing, such as textures, police mechanics, a wanted level system, NPCs, and the ability to shoot weapons. Despite these limitations, the game is functional and offers the exciting option to play with a controller. It currently supports only Xbox controllers, allowing you to map the controls according to your preference for a more personalized experience.

Additionally, the game provides a customizable graphics option, letting you choose between playing at 30 FPS or 60 FPS for smoother gameplay. While the game is still a work in progress and lacks certain gameplay features, it represents an impressive step forward in using AI for game development. So, give it a try and see what this evolving project has to offer. Enjoy your adventure! ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
